# Jenkins Pipeline Announcers
Given that the Jenkins community is now moving toward use of Pipeline scripts for job execution, which also allows for super easy integration of things like Slack, it seems like a good idea to provide some simple integration methods which can be utilized to easily announce the success/failure/questionable completion of Jobs in Jenkins.

This repo will hold an ever-broadening collection of these integrations.  Over time, I'll try to add more features to make these as useful as possible for build management, CI, CD, and all that fun stuff.

In the initial commit, this will only provide basic integration between Slack and Jenkins, but I'll expand on this as time goes by.
