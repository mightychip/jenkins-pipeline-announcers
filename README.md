# jenkins-pipeline-announcers
This is a simple repo meant to provide a shared library for Jenkins Pipeline scripts to use to announce build success/failure on various chat services (Slack, Discord, HipChat, etc.).  Over time, this library will be enhanced with greater numbers of chat service integrations.
